# WITH MORE TIME

### Would have added a way to clear the list 
Button at bottom of list section that sets all state value to 0
Would been method simlar to how I add values to products 

### Would added have uses of prices
Display price of each product below grid selection
And total price for eatting in and eatting out on bottom of List section

### Fill Header section with something 
Perhaps with time and softwere name

### Way to add multiple products at a time
click on product opens text box with descrition of product with way to add more one product

### Move the APi key in to env file

### Test and make the app deal with well with high numbers of products
